## 🧠 About Me

I'm a Computer Networking student with a strong interest in **Cybersecurity, Network Administration, and Distributed Systems**.  
I enjoy building hands-on labs, simulating real-world networks, and working on security-focused projects.

My learning style is very practical — I build things, break them, monitor them, and secure them.

Currently focusing on:
- Network security & monitoring
- Penetration testing labs
- Linux server & infrastructure projects
- Capstone-level system design
